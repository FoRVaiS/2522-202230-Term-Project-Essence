# Essence
Essence is heavily inspired from the likes of [Magicka][SteamMagicka], Touhou, and [Enter the Gungeon][SteamEtG]. We are creating a single-player fantasy-style RPG Dungeon Crawler Bullet Hell. The player seeks to improve their magical proficiency by defeating powerful dungeon creatures using various type of spells based on their class and absorbing new magical properties from stage bosses.

## How to Play
### Movement
Use [W], [A], [S], [D] (or your arrow keys) to move around

### Combat
Use your [SPACEBAR] to shoot while aiming with your mouse
